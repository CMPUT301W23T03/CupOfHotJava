# IHuntWithJavalins GitHub Homepage

* IHuntWithJavalins is a project and team tasked with creating the Android mobile application called 'QRHunter'.  
This app allows us to hunt for the coolest QR codes that score the most points. Players will run around scanning QR codes, barcodes, etc. trying to find barcodes and QR codes that give them the most points.

* See the ![wiki](https://github.com/CMPUT301W23T03/IHuntWithJavalins/wiki) for more information about the app.

* See the ![Mockups](https://github.com/CMPUT301W23T03/IHuntWithJavalins/wiki/User-Interface-Mockups-and-Storyboard-Sequences) for User Interface mockups of the app.
